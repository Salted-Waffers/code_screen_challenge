# Code Screen Challenge

## The question
Is it possible to create a screenshot of code which takes less bytes than code?

## Requirements
- screenshot must be readable (do not use font size 0)
- everyone must be able to reproduce code directly from the screenshot
- the code must do something (not necessarily useful)
- the code must be written in a language published before this challenge (newer versions of languages are allowed, for example Python 3.7)

## Sending solutions
Make pull request with code file and screen file. If you want to use non-common language, please provide instructions how to run your code.
